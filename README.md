# **🖖 _Space Academic System_**

### This system was born from college work, in which you can perform the main functions for managing an educational institution

## **👨🏻‍🚀 System requirements:**

1. The four basic operations (add/list/update/delete) for all modules (aspirants/teachers/subjects/classes/enrollments) in the system.
2. Use of conditional structures (if/elif/else) in the code.
3. Use of repetition structures (for or while) to navigate menus
4. Use of compound data structures (lists, dictionaries, and/or tuples) to organize data.
5. Use of files for the persistence of registered data.
6. Use of functions to modularize the main functionalities of the application.

    6.1. Functions must be used following good programming practices.

    6.2. If possible, reuse functions for different modules of the system (e.g.: a single function to include registration of students, teachers, subjects, classes and enrollments).

7. Data validations and control of possible exceptions/execution errors (try/except).
8. One file.py only.

**Note: These are the requirements listed by my college.**
